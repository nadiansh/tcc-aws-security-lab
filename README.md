## Strengthening Cloud Security Through a Cyber Training Environment in AWS

ðŸ“Œ **Objective**
- Develop a cloud-based cyber training environment within AWS to strengthen practical cloud security skills through simulated Red Team (offensive) and Blue Team (defensive) operations.
- Bridge Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) concepts with technical cloud defense by building a secure, auditable environment that demonstrates attack detection, remediation automation, and policy-driven security.

ðŸ’¡ **Skills Learned:**

- AWS Cloud architecture and network segmentation (VPC, subnets, route tables)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration and least-privilege enforcement
- Incident detection with GuardDuty, Security Hub, and CloudTrail
- Automated remediation with AWS Config + Systems Manager
- Threat hunting and log analysis using CloudWatch Logs and Flow Logs
- CloudFormation IaC (Infrastructure as Code) for repeatable deployments
- Red Team tactics: reconnaissance, exploitation, and S3 data exfiltration
- Blue Team defense: continuous monitoring, alert correlation, and mitigation

ðŸ”§ **Tools Used:**

- AWS Core Services:
- VPC â€¢ EC2 â€¢ S3 â€¢ IAM â€¢ CloudFormation â€¢ CloudWatch â€¢ CloudTrail â€¢ GuardDuty â€¢ Security Hub â€¢ Config â€¢ Systems Manager
- Kali Linux (penetration testing) â€¢ Nmap â€¢ curl â€¢ custom attack scripts
- Visualization/Documentation:
- Lucidchart (topology diagrams) â€¢ VS Code (YAML + scripting)
